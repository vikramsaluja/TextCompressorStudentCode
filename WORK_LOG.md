This means having each word have a corresponding value when compressing the file and then vica versa for where you would have to expand the file. |

| Dec 3   |  4:50-5:45pm  | During this time I tried to think of a totally new way to approach this problem and move on from my previous thinking. While trying to think of ways to represent something larger in a small way, I began to think about using binary. This is something that I thought of because each place is represented simply with a 0 or 1, just like lots of other things in cs, so it made me wonder if that could be a way to compress a file since it would make it much smaller. This also made me think of something similar to how booleans works but I am still unsure about how this compression alogoirthm would work in reality and translating it from an abstract thought. |

The way that my thinking changed was I started out by trying to see if each word could be represented with value to instead trying to figure out since there are 26 letters, if each letter or char could be represented using a series of 0s and 1s which would then still compress the file and be effective. |
