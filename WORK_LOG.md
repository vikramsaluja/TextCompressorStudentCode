| Dec 2   | 11:35-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    During this time I continued to think about if it would be possible to represent a text using numbered values and why that might not work. This means having each word have a corresponding value when compressing the file and then vica versa for where you would have to expand the file. |
| Dec 3   |  9:40-9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                                            Although after talking to Mr. Blick and continuing to understand the challange with my original idea and the issue that it faces I took some more time to think about if it would be possible to further my original idea and tweak it by having multiple ints that could represent certain words but I got stuck as it I could not think of any way that it would neccarily be different and/or benefical since the number of words you can represent would still be quite limited. |
| Dec 3   |  4:50-5:45pm  | During this time I tried to think of a totally new way to approach this problem and move on from my previous thinking. While trying to think of ways to represent something larger in a small way, I began to think about using binary. This is something that I thought of because each place is represented simply with a 0 or 1, just like lots of other things in cs, so it made me wonder if that could be a way to compress a file since it would make it much smaller. This also made me think of something similar to how booleans works but I am still unsure about how this compression alogoirthm would work in reality and translating it from an abstract thought. |
| Dec 4   |  8:20-8:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Adding on to my my previous idea I tried to think about and write down how this algorithm might work. The way that my thinking changed was I started out by trying to see if each word could be represented with value to instead trying to figure out since there are 26 letters, if each letter or char could be represented using a series of 0s and 1s which would then still compress the file and be effective. |
| Dec 9   |  1:15-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             During this time I focused on building the struture of the program and setting up the initial dictionary for compression. I created the TST and filled it was all 128 ASCII charecters and the main challange that I faced was figuring out how to properly encord the longest prefix. I thought about checking one character at a time but then I realized that I could use the getLongestPrefix method to be much more efficient. |
| Dec 11  | 10:55-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         During this time I continued to focus on my compress method. I encountered an issue where the program sometimes tried to look ahead past the end ot the input sring. This happened because I was always trying to add prefix + nextChar. To fix it, my thinking changed as I added a condition that checks both nextCode < L and lookAhead < input.length(). After adding in those 2 checks I was able to complete the compress method. |
| Dec 13  | 6:15pm-7:00pm |                                                                                                                                                      During this time I was able to complete the problem set. I finished writing the expand method but one challenge that I faced was understanding the LZW edge case where the codeword == nextCode. At first, this caused my expansion to be slightly off but then after reviewing the slides I realized that I needed to make a change. I also changed my codes from 8 bits to 12 bits because I was getting a compression ratio that was too high. However, with this change I was able to decrease my ratio to around 40%. |
